	<!-- CategoryMappings
     each Mapping defines a single match criterion, and a new category 
     to assign if the criterion is met.  
	     a.  matchType must be one of the following:  
	     	       equals   startsWith   endsWith   contains
	         and the matchType must be exactly as shown
	     b.  comparisons are case-insensitive.  e.g.,  if matchType="startsWith" 
	         and fragment="ADMIN", the following input values would match:
	         "Administrative"   "administrative"  "aDmIN22"
	     c.  the criterion are tested in the order, and when a match on a given
	         input value is successful, no remaining mappings are attempted
	         for that input value.  (i.e.,  no "chaining" occurs)
     examples (using the mappings defined below)
	     1.  "AD", "style", "frEEstyle" remap to "Cat1"
	     2.  "Ad2" remaps to "Cat2"
	     3.  "RAIN", "grain", "rainMAN" remap to "Cat3"
	     4.  "toil",  "Toiling"  remap to "Cat4"
	     5.  nothing remaps to "Cat5", because any matches would have already matched a prior criterion)
	     6.  "baseball" remains unchanged, because it doesn't match any criteria

	<!--  LoggableBlackList
	   Defines a set of criterion which "blacklist" a particular category
	   from being included in the daily Loggable and Loggable grand totals.
	     a. If BillableDeterminesLoggable = true, AND the
	        category is blacklisted, the blacklist takes precedence.
	     b. matchType must be one of the following:  
	     	       equals   startsWith   endsWith   contains
	        and the matchType must be exactly as shown
	     c. comparisons are case-insensitive
	     d. the blacklist is applied AFTER the Category Mappings are
	        applied
	   examples (using the criterion defined below)
	     1. "personal"  "PERSONAL"  "Defer" and "defeRRED" are all blacklisted
	-->
  <LoggableBlacklist>
    <Criterion matchType="equals" fragment="personal" />
    <Criterion matchType="startsWith" fragment="defer" />
  </LoggableBlacklist>

  <!-- RoundingIncrement
       Specifies how times are rounded, fractional hours.  Possible 
       values are:
         0.01 (approx. 30 seconds, but UI calls it "no rounding")
         0.05 (nearest 3 minute increment), 
         0.10 (nearest 6 minute increment)
